# First Programs

1. Program 1:
Create a program in interactive form to print the message "Python is Cool"

### On Windows - Interactive - [See Code](0_Program1_Windows/)
- Step 1 - Open Terminal cmd, powershell
- Step 2 - type the command: python
- Step 3 - type the code: print("Python is Cool")

### On Linux - Interactive - [See Code](0_Program1_Linux/)
- Step 1 - Open Terminal BASH
- Step 2 - type the command: python3
- Step 3 - type the code: print("Python is Cool")

Note: This is also known as the Python Interpreter or a REPL (for 'Read Evaluate Print Loop').

1. Program 2:
Create a program in non-interactive form to print the message "Python is Cool"

- Step 1 - Crearet a file with any Text editor, and name the file program0.py
Note: .py is the file extension for python scripts
- Step 2 - open the terminal, and go to current directory where is the script
- Step 3 - type the command: python program0.py
OUTPUT: python is cool
[See Code](1_Program/)

On lInux we can create a special script that skip this step of type always the command python <filename>, using script with shebang: #!/usr/python3

### Example:

- Step 1 - Create a script program1.py
- Step 2 - Type the follow code:
```
#!/usr/bin/python3
print("python is cool")
```

- Step 3 - Save the script and add execution permissions: 
chmod u+x program1.py

- Step 4 - Execute the script:
./program1
OUTPUT: python is cool

[See Code](1_Program1/)
